This repository holds the official pages of pyroutes.

To build the pages you need to make sure pyroutes is in your path (by a
symblink in the _sphinx folder or similar) and that you have updated the
sphinx-to-github submodule. Do this using git submodule update.

Once all is set, run make html to build the file. We should find an elegant way
to include the files on the root, other than moving them there... Patches
accepted =)
